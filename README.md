# extract-cert

A lightweight tool/container that automatically extracts TLS certificates from a `acme.json` file generated by Traefik and exports them in PEM format.  
Useful for inspection, backup, migration, or integrating Traefik-managed certificates into other systems.

## Features

- Parse `acme.json` produced by Traefik.
- Extract all stored certificates and private keys.
- Export each certificate (and optionally full chain) as PEM files.
- Organize output per domain for easy consumption.

- A valid **`acme.json`** from Traefik (readable by the container)
